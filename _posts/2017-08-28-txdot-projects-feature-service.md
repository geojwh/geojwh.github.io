This is a another YouTube documentation piece I created for GIS users at my current job. Adding this feature service to ArcGIS Desktop software allows great flexibility to query, visualize, and analyze the data. Users can also export the feature service to save the data locally if necessary. The service is hosted on ArcGIS Online (AGO) and, while I am a promoter of free and open-source software etc, I acknowledge how easy and powerful AGO is and I take advantage of the platform at work often. One of the goals at my job is to educate users within the Austin district to realize the potential of this framework and how they can use it to be more efficient and get real value from our geospatial data.
