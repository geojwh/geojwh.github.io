I have been flipping back and forth testing different frameworks for the last year or so, but I think I am finally done. I have made a choice, I think...

<!--description-->

I have chosen a framework for my personal site/blog. And guess what? It is, not suprisingly, the most popular open-source static site generator according to [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/).

I have tested [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/#), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), and now [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) during this time, and I have to say that these are all pretty solid. I eventually chose to go with Jekyll due to its seamless integration with GitHub and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I wanted to use GitHub to host my content because it is just easy, and I was already familiar with it. Another reason is that there are a ton of great themes for Jekyll sites out there. I found this theme searching around and I liked how simple it is, with great responsiveness. David Lin aka [wild-flame](https://github.com/wild-flame) is the developer of this Jekyll theme, which I think he actually built to make writing in Chinese fonts more efficient? Im not sure about that, I write in English so...

Anyway, Jekyll is pretty cool so far, but I tend to be one of those tinkerers so we will see if I end up testing any other frameworks and switching. Hopefully not...
