Below are projects I have worked on or am currently working on. Some are side projects, some are directly related to my current job at TNRIS, some were early projects when I first started coding and writing scripts. Check at my full GitHub profile and what I've been up to lately [@jwhaney](https://github.com/jwhaney).

- ### [api.tnris.org](https://api.tnris.org/api/v1)
> Texas Natural Resources Application Programming Interface built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the Django [restframework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). This API feeds all kinds of data to a a few different applications, mainly [data.tnris.org](https://data.tnris.org) and [tnris.org](https://tnris.org). There is an administration console (requires login credentials; not public) that acts as a content management system to update information for the agency's website, upload resources for data collections available on data.tnris.org, upload image resources to AWS S3 for use in tnris.org or wherever users need, upload documents to S3, etc. This is the central brain of TNRIS right here. See Github repo here: [https://github.com/TNRIS/api.tnris.org](https://github.com/TNRIS/api.tnris.org)

- ### [data.tnris.org](https://data.tnris.org/)
> Where the public gets GIS data. React.js front-end using data from [api.tnris.org](https://api.tnris.org). See Github repo here: [https://github.com/TNRIS/dataHub](https://github.com/TNRIS/dataHub)

- ### [tnris.org](https://tnris.org)
> The Texas Natural Resources Information System's main website. Custom static site generator using Node, NPM, Nunjucks, Gulp, Metalsmith, Webpack, etc. See Github repo here: [https://github.com/TNRIS/tnris.org](https://github.com/TNRIS/tnris.org)

- ### [2022.texasstatewaterplan](https://2022.texasstatewaterplan.org/)
> The latest version of the state of Texas' water plan developed at the Texas Water Development Board. I did not develop the original version of this application, but worked on front-end and data updates for this latest version. Built with Node and React.

- ### [TNRIS Bulk Downloader Utility](https://github.com/jwhaney/bulk-downloader)
> Script/utility to bulk download an entire collection's resources at [data.tnris.org](https://data.tnris.org). Built using Python3 and the Tkinter GUI library with a few other packages as well.

- ### [centexgis prototype](https://github.com/centexgis/prototype2)
> Not sure if this will ever be used, but I was once working on updating the theme of the current CentexGIS website (below project bullet). Improved responsiveness and user interaction. Jekyll, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub. View it live at [http://centexgis.com/prototype2](http://centexgis.com/prototype2).

- ### [centexgis](https://github.com/centexgis/centexgis.github.io)
> Current CentexGIS website (as of February 2018) that I update/maintain. I inherited this content from another developer and am currently in the process of updating the site to a new theme. Custom domain with CNAME file, Jekyll, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. View it live at [http://centexgis.com](http://centexgis.com).

- ### [leaflet txdot austin district planning map](https://jwhaney.github.io/planning-map)
> This is a mapping application I developed (but never finished unfortunately) from scratch using the esri-leaflet JavaScript API, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc. It was an effort to create an open-source version of the app we actually did use at the bullet below.

- ### [esri txdot austin district planning map](https://txdot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a13a2f06aaf242c5807abb33eb36a3f1)
> This is a mapping application I built using the ESRI Web AppBuilder which is a WSIWYG application builder. It is super simple to build rather complex web applications. This was built for my old job at TxDOT to display custom district feature services which assist in better transportation planning and project development.

- ### [adelberts brewery web map](https://adelbertsbeer.github.io/)
> A simple web map developed for [Adelberts craft brewery](http://adelbertsbeer.com) here in Austin, TX. The map shows counties where the brewery's beer can be purchased from different distributors. There is a link to the map on the brewery website as well. Not sure they use this anymore. See code repo here: [https://github.com/adelbertsbeer/adelbertsbeer.github.io](https://github.com/adelbertsbeer/adelbertsbeer.github.io)

> Super simple Python program to remind you to take a break at work. I set this up on my work machine using Windows task scheduler so when I login, the program runs automatically every two hours to remind me to take a break once in a while. You should too!

- ### [acc interaction design portal](https://jwhaney.github.io/acc-interaction-design)
> This is a portal of exercises I completed early on when learning to code. Was developed during the Austin Community College course Interaction Design with CSS & JavaScript.
