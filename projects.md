Below are some projects I have worked on or am currently working on. Some are side projects so I can brush up on my skillz, others were developed for my job.

- ### [esri txdot austin district planning map](https://txdot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a13a2f06aaf242c5807abb33eb36a3f1)
> This is a mapping application I built using the ESRI Web AppBuilder which is a WSIWYG application builder. It is super simple to build rather complex web applications. This was built for my current job to display custom district feature services which assist in better transportation planning and project development.

- ### [leaflet txdot austin district planning map](https://atxdot.github.io/planning-map)
