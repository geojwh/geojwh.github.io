    were early projects when I first started coding and writing scripts. Check at my full GitHub profile and what I've been up to lately here:

          a few different applications, mainly <a class="olive" href="https://data.tnris.org">data.tnris.org</a> and <a class="olive" href="https://tnris.org">tnris.org</a>. There is an administration console (requires login credentials; not public) that acts as a content
          management system to update information for the agency's website, upload resources for data collections available on data.tnris.org, upload image resources to AWS S3 for use in tnris.org or wherever users need, upload documents to S3, etc.
