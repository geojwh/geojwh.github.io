Hello, my name is John. I live in Austin, TX and work in the field of Geographic Information Systems/Science, so I like maps! I am also a web development and open-source enthusiast, a lover of live music, [a dog admirer](assets/img/dog.jpg), as well as an avid [traveler](assets/img/travel.jpg) and [adventure](assets/img/adventure.jpg) seeker.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:geojwh@gmail.com) if you would like to collaborate on a project, or just to say hi. I dont care for traditional social media, but I do enjoy social coding so I am decently active on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwhaney). Lets build something!
