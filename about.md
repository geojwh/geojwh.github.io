Hi, my name is John. I live in Austin, TX and work as a Software Developer [building applications](https://tnris.org/applications-and-utilities/) that [deliver geospatial data](https://data.tnris.org) to the people of Texas. I am also an [open-source](https://www.linuxmint.com/) promoter, a lover of [live music](https://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/music/), [a dog admirer](assets/img/dog.jpg), avid [traveler](assets/img/travel.jpg), and [adventure](assets/img/adventure.jpg) seeker.

Feel free to [contact me](https://goo.gl/forms/5JCc7RdLgOQi4LBn2) if you would like to collaborate on a project, or just to say hi. I dont care for traditional social media, but I am active on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwhaney). Lets build something!
