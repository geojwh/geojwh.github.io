Hello, my name is John. I live in Austin, TX and work in the field of Geographic Information Systems/Science. In other words, I like maps! I am also a web development enthusiast and [open-source](http://www.osgeo.org/) promoter, a lover of [live music](https://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/music/), [a dog admirer](assets/img/dog.jpg), avid [traveler](assets/img/travel.jpg), and [adventure](assets/img/adventure.jpg) seeker.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact.html) if you would like to collaborate on a project, or just to say hi. I dont care for traditional social media, but I do enjoy social coding so Im fairly active on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwhaney). Lets build something!
